# #100DaysOfCode
Hey there! This is a personal commitment to levelling myself up in terms of understanding what really goes on behind those codes. My main focus for these 100 days will be DSA, followed by mastering React.js, learning new frameworks like Next.js, Typescript and resuming my learning of Three.js.

## Goals
1. Incorporate my understanding of DSA to solve problems as well as optimise performance
2. Create 15 webapps
3. Land a full time role as a front-end / full-stack developer

## Rules
1. At least 3 hours of code a day
2. Journal and review about what I have learnt that day
3. Share my progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sallyhoneybee) and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@thefatdog)
